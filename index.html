  <p><em><strong>Computer Science Engineering student</strong> at Amity School
      of Engineering and Technology</em></p>
  <p>I am a budding programmer from Delhi, India. My passion for
    programming and computers led me to pursue Bachelors of technology in
    computer science engineering. I am efficient with coding in JAVA, C, C++ and
    PYTHON but if I were to choose, my preferred language for coding is PYTHON.
    I love to design new codes and brainstorm over how to design new codes, I
    also do front end development for android, web and IOS mobile applications
    in flutter using dart language. I am also learning German language as an extra
    skill.</p>
